# Privacy Policy — AIPDFReader

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2026

## Introduction
At **AIPDFReader**, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the AIPDFReader iOS app (“AIPDFReader”, “we”) handles data when you use the app.

## Summary (Key Points)
- **PDF processing involves the cloud**: The app uploads your selected PDFs to cloud storage and uses a remote service to extract text and generate summaries, key points, and Q&A.
- **On-device storage**: Summaries, key points, and chat history are stored on your device so you can revisit them.
- **No accounts required**: We use Firebase Anonymous Authentication to enable cloud uploads without requiring your email, name, or phone number.
- **Cloud retention**: Currently, deleting a document locally does not automatically remove the uploaded file from cloud storage.

## Information We Collect

### 1) Data You Provide
- **PDF files** you select from your device to be processed.
- **Questions** you ask the AI about your documents.

### 2) Data Generated by the App
- **Extracted text** derived from your uploaded PDFs.
- **AI outputs** such as document summaries, key points, and answers to your questions.
- **Document identifiers** used to manage your files (derived from the filename).

### 3) Data Stored on Your Device (App Settings & State)
AIPDFReader stores certain data locally using iOS storage (`UserDefaults`) to function properly:
- A list of documents and their metadata (including original filenames).
- Generated summaries, key points, and chat history.
- Optional app settings (e.g., “localhost mode” and configuration URLs).

## Where Your Data Goes

### Cloud Storage
When you upload a document, the PDF and its extracted text are stored in **Firebase Storage**. This is necessary for the remote processing service to access the content.

### Remote Processing
To generate summaries and answer questions, data is sent to a backend processing service. Depending on your configuration, this is either:
- A hosted processing service (default).
- A local server you run (if “localhost mode” is enabled).

### Logs
In debug builds, the app may print diagnostic logs for troubleshooting. Release builds do not include verbose console logging.

## Third-Party Data Collection
AIPDFReader integrates with third-party services to provide core functionality:

#### Google Firebase
We use Firebase for:
- **Authentication**: Anonymous sign-in to securely manage cloud access.
- **Storage**: Hosting PDFs and extracted text files.

#### Remote Processing Infrastructure
Used to process documents and generate AI responses. These providers may process data on their infrastructure and collect standard service data (e.g., IP address and request metadata) as part of their operations.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- **On-device data**: You can delete a document from the app’s list at any time. This removes the local metadata and generated results from your device.
- **Cloud data**: Deleting a document locally does not currently trigger a deletion from Firebase Storage. If you require cloud data deletion, please contact us via the GitHub repository issues.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your data in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. You should avoid uploading sensitive documents that you are not comfortable processing in the cloud.

## Children’s Privacy
AIPDFReader is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted with a revised **Last Updated** date.
