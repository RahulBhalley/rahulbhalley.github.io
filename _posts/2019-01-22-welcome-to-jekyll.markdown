You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

```python
x = 5
def func(x):
  return x
func(x)
```
\\[f(x) = 2^{x} + 3_{y}\\]

\\( h\_t = \tanh ( W\_{hh} h\_{t-1} + W\_{xh} x\_t ) \\)

\\( \\zeta(x\_{r\_{1}}, x\_{f\_{1}}) \\geq 0 \\)

\\[\zeta(x_{r_{1}}, x_{r_{2}}) \leq \zeta(x_{r_{1}}, x_{f_{1}}) + \zeta(x_{f_{1}}, x_{r_{2}})\\]
