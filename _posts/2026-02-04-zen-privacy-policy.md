# Privacy Policy — Zen

**Last Updated:** February 4, 2026

## Introduction
At **Zen**, we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it's used, and the choices you have when using the Zen app.

## Summary (Key Points)
- **Core features work offline**, but some features (like **rewarded ads** and **analytics**) require an internet connection.
- We **do not require accounts** and we do not ask for your email or phone number to use the app.
- If you enable **Apple Health** integration, Zen can **save and read** certain Health data (with your permission).
- We use **third-party services** for **rewarded ads** (Google AdMob) and **app analytics** (Firebase Analytics).

## Information We Collect

### 1) Information You Choose to Provide (Stored Locally)
- **Optional name** (used to personalize text in the app).  
  This is stored on your device using iOS storage and is not required to use the app.

### 2) Data Stored on Your Device (App Settings & State)
Zen stores certain data locally so the app can function properly, such as:
- Onboarding completion state
- Reminder preferences and selected reminder times
- Premium/unlock status (e.g., which exercises were unlocked via rewarded ads and their unlock timing)
- Recent selections used to improve the in-app experience (e.g., last emotion selection)

This data is stored locally (for example, using iOS app storage like `UserDefaults` / `AppStorage`).

### 3) Apple Health Data (Optional, With Permission)
If you choose to enable Apple Health integration, Zen may request permission to **read and write** Health data, such as:
- **Mindful minutes / mindful sessions** (e.g., breathing/meditation session entries)
- **State of Mind** (mood/emotion entries)

**Important:** Apple Health data is managed by Apple's Health app and your device settings. You can revoke access at any time in iOS Settings.

### 4) Third-Party Data Collection (Ads & Analytics)
Even if Zen itself does not ask you for identifying details, **third-party SDKs** may collect information automatically when they are active:

#### Google AdMob (Rewarded Ads)
To provide rewarded ads that unlock certain content, the app uses **Google AdMob**. AdMob may collect information such as:
- Device and app information (e.g., device model, OS version)
- Approximate location inferred from IP address
- Ad performance and interaction data (impressions, taps, diagnostics)
- Identifiers used for advertising and fraud prevention (subject to your iOS settings)

#### Firebase Analytics (Usage Measurement)
To understand app usage and improve the experience, the app uses **Firebase Analytics**, which may collect:
- App interaction and usage events (e.g., screen views, session completion events)
- Device and app information
- Performance/diagnostic data related to app stability and usage patterns

## How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide app functionality (sessions, reminders, unlocking content)
- Save optional entries to Apple Health (only if you enable it)
- Measure usage and improve features (analytics)
- Provide and measure rewarded ads (ads)

## Sharing of Information
- We **do not sell** your personal information.
- We share information **only as needed** with service providers used by the app (for example, Google AdMob and Firebase) to deliver ads and analytics functionality.

## Permissions the App May Request
Depending on your choices, Zen may request:
- **Health access (Apple Health / HealthKit):** to log and/or read mindful minutes and state of mind data
- **Notifications:** to send reminders and emotion check-in prompts

The app does **not** request access to your contacts, photos library, camera, or microphone for its core features.

## Data Retention
- **On-device app data** remains until you delete the app or reset it (e.g., by deleting/reinstalling).
- **Apple Health data** remains in Apple Health until you delete it from the Health app.
- **Ad/analytics data** retention is handled by the respective providers under their policies and settings.

## Children's Privacy
Zen is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we'll address it.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted with a revised **Last Updated** date.
