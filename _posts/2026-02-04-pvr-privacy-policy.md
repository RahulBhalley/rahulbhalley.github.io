## Our Privacy Commitment

**PVR is designed with privacy as our top priority.** Our app operates completely offline and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers or third parties.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Don't Collect

- ❌ **No Internet Access:** PVR does not require or use internet connectivity

### What We Do (Local Processing Only)

- ✅ **Video Recording:** Records video using your device's camera
- ✅ **Local Storage:** Saves recordings directly to your device's Photos app

## Data Storage and Security

### Secure Local Storage

- All video recordings are saved directly to your device's **Photos app**
- Recordings never leave your device
- No cloud storage or external servers are used
- Data is protected by your device's built-in security features

### iOS Integration

- Access to recordings is controlled by your device's privacy settings

## Permissions Required

PVR only requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:

- **Camera Access:** Required to record video
- **Photos Access:** Required to save recordings to your Photos library

These permissions are used solely for the stated purposes and nothing else.

## Data Retention

- Video recordings are retained in your Photos app until you choose to delete them
- App settings are stored locally on your device and can be cleared through iOS settings
- No data is retained on our servers because we don't use any servers

## Children's Privacy

PVR does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. Since our app doesn't collect any personal data and operates entirely offline, it is compliant with children's privacy protection regulations.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since we don't collect user data or have user accounts, we cannot notify individual users of changes.
